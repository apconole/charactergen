  <description>The northern barbaric lands are inhabited by 12 semi-united tribes, with the Gildas, Badonicus, and Wulfgora comprising the strongest three. These ruling clans are usually quite warlike, taking more than their share from the others and constantly plotting to overthrow their rivals.
The remaining tribes (the Eriksdotters, Donoughs, Bulgars, Ealdse, Avars, Suebi, Wixna, Spalda, and Belmga) keep to their own borders. They usually do not have the might to resist one of the stronger tribes.
Few, if any, riches hail from the northern lands. The folk who dwell there are distrustful of magic (and fearful even of their priests), and are rarely, if ever, educated beyond some minor runes. What does come from the north are the tough iron hides of northern warriors.
